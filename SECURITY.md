# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord or Matrix.

If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/7ZKs7HadK5)
and then message Armok.

You can contact deltanedas securely on matrix with [https://matrix.to/#/@deltanedas:kde.org](@deltanedas:kde.org)

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give
you permission to do so**.
