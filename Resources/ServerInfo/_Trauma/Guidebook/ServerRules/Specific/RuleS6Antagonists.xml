  - GO CRAZY

  - If you're going to kill a ton of people, make it interesting.
  - If you are a friendly antag you will be blown up.

  - Do not destroy the station, for example maxcaps or singuloosing.
  - Listen to the headrevs orders.

  # Traitor
  - You are not required to follow your objectives.
  - If you are going to affect lots of people, make it interesting.

  # Midrounds antagonists
  - This applies to roles such as abductor or vox raiders, as well as the other minor midround antagonists.
  - You are required to follow your objective, do not just go around killing people.
