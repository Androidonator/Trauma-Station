  # Specific Role Rule 1: Cyborg / AI

  These rules apply to any silicon role with laws.

  - As a silicon, your laws are your in-game rules.
  - The order of your laws is their priority, lower laws are more important than higher ones.
  - If your crew HUD uses green icons, anyone with them is crew. For non-standard laws, use your judgement to interpret them and try to be consistent.
  - If orders conflict, you may decide how to resolve the conflict.
  - Harm is defined as physical harm.
  - You only have to prevent your laws from being changed if stated in your laws.
  - You can rules-lawyer to an extent, if someone misspells a name it is their fault.
  - You can ignore extremely unreasonable orders, for example: "Do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station"
  - Act like a robot.
