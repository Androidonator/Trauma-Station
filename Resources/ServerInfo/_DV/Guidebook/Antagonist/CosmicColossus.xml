  You are an Entropic Colossus, a towering monstrosity of malign plating and dendritic infestation. Your purpose is the same as that of the [color=#4cabb3]Cosmic Cult[/color]: The end of all things.

  Some Colossi are remnants. Perhaps survivors of a conflict borne of The Unknown's influence, or the product of some strange Noospheric anomaly. These Colossi drift across the distal black of space until their energies deplete... Or until they impact civilization.

  ## Influences

  Entropic Colossi are posessed of powerful [color=#4cabb3]Malign Influences[/color], with which a capable colossus may lay waste to its enemies.

  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Entropic Sunder:[/bold][/color] Warp to the target location and unleash a shockwave of malign energy, briefly knocking down everyone around.
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Colossal Ingress:[/bold][/color] Use your colossal strength to force open a doorway. Even securely bolted doorways will be torn open by your titanic power.
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Slumber Shell:[/bold][/color] Slumber your body for a period of time to regenerate integrity. Must be done on stable ground. This will restore you for exactly half the damage you've taken.

  Colossi that have encountered the station by happenstance also have this influence:
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Colossal Ingress:[/bold][/color] Use your colossal strength to force open a doorway. Even securely bolted doorways will be torn open by your titanic power.

  ## Effigy of Entropy

  Some Colossi may call forth an [color=#4cabb3]Effigy of Entropy[/color]. The effigy is a dangerously unstable malign anomaly, and should be dealt with by security immediately!
